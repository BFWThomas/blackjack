# blackjack

## Goal
The goal of this project is to run a Blackjack simulator where the user can set a number of rule changes to simulate what it is like in a casino.
The tool can be used to train basic strategy and counting.

Simulations can be run to predict statistical wins/losses and estimate earnings based on given settings.
